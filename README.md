# EE-271-Lab-7

Task - Improve on Lab 6 by modifying your code to create a Tug-Of-War game with the computer as the second player
       The program should be able to execute the following:
       
       1. Must be able to play multiple games! Once a game is won, the counter will increment the score of whoever has won
          and will reset the playing field so the game can be played again
       2. The computer's button presses must be randomly regenerated using a Linear Feedback Shift Register -
          if the randomly generated number is greater than the binary number represented on the switches, it counts 
          as a button press (this means that the swithces control the speed of the computer)
